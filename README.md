### Hi there, I am TalentedEuropian( Not Asian Anymore :cry: ) ðŸ‘‹
- :books: I am currently a grade 12 student in a no name school in the Philippines.
- :dna: People call me "batak" even though I think that I'm just your average Joe.
- :microscope: I am currently learning Java and the whole Spring Framework.
- :herb: My next goal would be to learn Microservices Architecture and use NoSql Databases.
- :thinking: My current goal is to make pet projects and hopefully get a job even before graduating college.
- :scientist: My end goal is to become a "not so typical" backend developer in the Philippines. I plan to be better every day and be the developer that's considered "skilled"
